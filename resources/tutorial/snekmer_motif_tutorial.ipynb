    "# Snekmer Motif Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Motif</b> is a pipeline for identification of functionally and structurally relevant amino acid motifs using feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motif uses the output of Model and a set of user-supplied protein families to train support vector machines for in- or out-of-family classification and find which kmers are the most informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to use Snekmer Motif to find the kmers most indicative of membership in 3 small families.\n",

    "    To ensure that snekmer is available in the Jupyter notebook do the following:\n",

    "### Notes on Using Snekmer\n",
    "\n",
    "Snekmer assumes that the user will primarily process input files using the command line. For more detailed instructions, refer to the [README](https://github.com/PNNL-CompBio/Snekmer).\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic process for running Snekmer Motif is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Verify that your file directory structure is correct and that the top-level directory contains a **_config.yaml_** file.\n",
    "   - A **_config.yaml_** template has been included in the Snekmer codebase at **_resources/config.yaml_**.\n",
    "2. Modify the **_config.yaml_** with the desired parameters.\n",
    "3. Use the command line to navigate to the directory containing both the **_config.yaml_** file and **_input_** directory.\n",
    "4. If you are using background families you are not interested in identifying functionally relevant kmers from, run 'snekmer model', then move the FASTA files containing those families to the 'background' directory. You may skip this step if you are performing feature selection on all input families.\n",
    "5. Run 'snekmer motif'."
