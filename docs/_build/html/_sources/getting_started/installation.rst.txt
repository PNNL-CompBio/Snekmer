Installation
============

We recommend using Anaconda to create a virtual environment.
Anaconda handles dependencies and versioning, which simplifies the process of installation.

Procedure
---------

Use conda to install an environment from the YML file with all
required dependencies. (Note: Users may either download the YML file
directly from the repository, or clone the repository beforehand
using the `git clone` command below.)

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the environment:

```
conda activate snekmer
```

Install Snekmer using pip (note: git clone step is optional if you
already have the repo cloned locally):

```
# option 1: clone repository (if you haven't already) and install
git clone https://github.com/PNNL-CompBio/Snekmer.git
pip install Snekmer

# option 2: direct install
pip install git+https://github.com/PNNL-CompBio/Snekmer
```

The package should now be ready to use!

#### Troubleshooting Notes

For Windows users: If you are running into conflicts/errors when creating
  the conda environment in Windows, you may need to install the minimal
  version of Snakemake instead:

```bash
conda create -n snekmer -c conda-forge -c bioconda biopython matplotlib numpy pandas seaborn snakemake-minimal scikit-learn
```
