Running the Tutorial
--------------------

To run an example set of jobs use the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda activate snekmer
   cd resources/tutorial/demo_example
   ./run_demo.sh

This will execute the snekmer model, search, and cluster modes in succession
on a set of three input families and produce output files for each in output.
