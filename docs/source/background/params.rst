Parameter Selection
===================

Snekmer's clustering mode uses various metrics, which are 
determined via user-defined parameters, in order to group 
protein sequences into clusters based on similarity. These 
clusters are thus sensitive to the parameters used to 
define similarity thresholds for sequences that are 
grouped thusly.

Why do I need to select parameters?
-----------------------------------

Different protein sequence sets will consist of proteins 
of varying lengths and similarities. Thus,
